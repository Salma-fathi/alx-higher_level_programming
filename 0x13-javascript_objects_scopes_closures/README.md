# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Description
In this project, we dive deeper into JavaScript by learning about objects, scopes, and closures. We explore various concepts such as creating objects, understanding `this`, working with prototypes, and implementing inheritance. Additionally, we learn about closures and their significance in JavaScript programming.
